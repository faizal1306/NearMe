        <p>
            The 57 km long beach is <strong>one among the longest in Asia and the second-longest in the Coromandel Coast</strong>. The historical importance of Silver Beach is reflected through Fort St. David, one of the three significant forts constructed by the British Empire, which is located there. While the Pallavas and Medieval Cholas were in power, <strong>Cuddalore was an important town.</strong>

The waves on the beach are mild, making it ideal for swimming. The crabs on the shore are to be avoided, though. The sunrise on the beach is a must-have experience for every beach lover. You can see a few beach resorts close to the shore.  Although primarily a fishing port, the town today has had a number of chemical and pharmaceutical industries since SIPCOT was established.

        <p>
            <strong>Cuddalore Port </strong>is an open (anchorage) port located on the <strong>eastern coast of Tamil Nadu</strong>, at the confluence of the <strong> Uppanar (or Paravanar) rivers in the Bay of Bengal</strong>. Ships anchor offshore, and cargo is transferred through small boats or barges between the ships and the shore. The anchorage takes place 0.5 nautical miles offshore in depths of 8-10 meters. This port handles small vessels (or inland vessels), and under the Sagarmala/Inland Waterways project of the Union Ministry of Shipping, it is being developed into a full-fledged port with the extension of breakwaters, construction of cargo berths, and dredging of the channel. This development is supported by a grant from the Union Ministry of Shipping.
